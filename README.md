# File Directory Sorter

This GUI program allows the user to select a directory on their computer and organize the files within this directory. The program will search through all subdirectories, move all the files to the parent directory the user selected, and delete the empty folders. It also gives the user the choice to organize the files into new folders by their extension. This provides a convenient way to organize a messy desktop, or any other folder.
